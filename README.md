# sharedExpense

[sharedExpense] is an cloud based expense tracker, to track cash expenses in your household. 
It consists of an Android App and an arbitrary storage accessed by a defined REST-API. The data is not stored on your phone, but on your own storage solution.

In the `example` folder are different example storage implementations which you can use or extend.
